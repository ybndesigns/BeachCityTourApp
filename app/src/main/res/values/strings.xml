    <string name="filler_paragraph">This is a filler paragraph. It is full of filler. Maybe it has a little joy or
        a little sadness. Most likely it contains confusion and boredom. But someone could not be bothered to fill
        this area with its intended content, so here is this paragraph instead. Full of filler. You should pity the
        person who decided to write this. Most people would go the route of Loren Ipsum or the like, but this person
        did not want to be bothered to find some nonsense with just the correct length. So instead they decided to
        write, stream of consciousness style, until they found the length satisfactory. One could say this was a
        monster of their own making. Or perhaps you sympathize with this poor soul and their illogical perfectionism.
        No matter, regardless of the stance that you, the reader, takes, it still leaves you with this paragraph.
        Full of filler.</string>
